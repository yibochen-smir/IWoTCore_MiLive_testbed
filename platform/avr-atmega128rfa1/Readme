To drive the IWoTCore board and its extend board, especially its peripherals, such as:
1 Air Temperature Sensor
1 Light Sensor
1 RS232/USB Slave Port
IEEE802.15.4 Wireless Access Medium
1 Extend Port enable to connect with different adapter boards
1 Port enable to directly connect with Raspberry Pi
4 Watermark Soil moisture sensors.
It is necessary to port the existing drivers from the Software Package for IWoTCore+MiLive (Hong-ling SHI) to the Contiki OS.
